# ðŸ“Š Step 1: Learn the Fundamentals

## 1.1 Understanding Data Analytics

Before diving into tools and coding, it's essential to understand what Data Analytics is and how it is used in real-world scenarios.

### ðŸ“Œ What is Data Analytics?

Data Analytics is the process of examining raw data to uncover trends, patterns, and insights that help businesses make informed decisions.

### ðŸ“Œ Types of Data Analytics

There are four main types of analytics, each answering different business questions:

| **Type of Analytics**     | **Purpose**                                    | **Example**                                  |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Descriptive Analytics**  | Summarizes past data                         | Monthly sales report, Website traffic trends |
| **Diagnostic Analytics**   | Explains why something happened              | Why did sales drop last quarter?             |
| **Predictive Analytics**   | Uses data to forecast future outcomes        | Predicting customer churn or sales trends   |
| **Prescriptive Analytics** | Recommends actions based on predictions      | What should a business do to increase sales? |

#### ðŸ”¹ Example:
A retail company wants to increase sales. They use:
- **Descriptive Analytics** to see last yearâ€™s sales trends.
- **Diagnostic Analytics** to find out why sales dipped in certain months.
- **Predictive Analytics** to forecast next monthâ€™s demand.
- **Prescriptive Analytics** to decide on pricing or promotions.

## 1.2 Mathematics & Statistics for Data Analytics

Since Data Analysts work with numbers, understanding statistics and mathematical concepts is crucial.

### ðŸ“Œ Basic Algebra & Probability

- **Algebra:** Helps in working with formulas, equations, and data modeling.
- **Probability:** Helps in making predictions and assessing risk.

#### ðŸ”¹ Example:
If 60% of customers buy product A and 30% buy product B, what is the probability of a customer buying both?  
*Use Bayes' Theorem for probability-based predictions.*

### ðŸ“Œ Descriptive Statistics

Descriptive statistics summarize data using:

- **Mean (Average):** The sum of values divided by the number of values.
- **Median:** The middle value when data is sorted.
- **Mode:** The most frequently occurring value.
- **Variance & Standard Deviation:** Measures how spread out the data is.

#### ðŸ”¹ Example:
If you analyze customer ages, finding the **average age (mean)** and the most common age (mode) helps businesses target marketing efforts.

### ðŸ“Œ Inferential Statistics

Inferential statistics allow you to make conclusions about a population based on sample data:

- **Hypothesis Testing (A/B Testing):** Used to test marketing strategies.
- **Confidence Intervals:** Measures reliability of an estimate.
- **Correlation vs. Causation:** Determines if two variables move together.

#### ðŸ”¹ Example:
A company changes its website layout. Using **A/B Testing**, they compare the old vs. new layouts to check if sales increased.

## 1.3 Excel & Google Sheets for Data Analysis

Many companies use **Excel/Google Sheets** for data analysis before transitioning to SQL or Python.

### ðŸ“Œ Essential Excel Functions for Analysts

- **Basic Mathematical Operations:** `SUM`, `AVERAGE`, `COUNT`
- **Searching Data:** `VLOOKUP`, `HLOOKUP`, `INDEX-MATCH`
- **Text Functions:** `TR
