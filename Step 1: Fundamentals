# 🚀 Data Analyst Roadmap

## Step 1: Learn the Fundamentals

### 1.1 📊 Understanding Data Analytics

Before diving into tools and coding, it's important to grasp the core concepts behind **Data Analytics** and how it's applied in real-world scenarios.

#### 🔍 What is Data Analytics?
Data Analytics is the process of examining raw data to uncover trends, patterns, and insights that help businesses make informed decisions.

#### 🧐 Types of Data Analytics:
There are four main types, each answering different business questions:

| **Type of Analytics**     | **Purpose**                                    | **Example**                                  |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Descriptive Analytics**  | Summarizes past data                         | Monthly sales reports, Website traffic trends |
| **Diagnostic Analytics**   | Explains why something happened              | Why did sales drop last quarter?             |
| **Predictive Analytics**   | Uses data to forecast future outcomes        | Predicting customer churn or sales trends   |
| **Prescriptive Analytics** | Recommends actions based on predictions      | What should a business do to increase sales? |

#### 💡 Example Use Case:
A retail company wants to increase sales:
- **Descriptive Analytics:** View last year’s sales trends.
- **Diagnostic Analytics:** Identify reasons for sales drops.
- **Predictive Analytics:** Forecast demand for next month.
- **Prescriptive Analytics:** Suggest pricing strategies or promotions.

### 1.2 📐 Mathematics & Statistics for Data Analytics

Data Analysts work with numbers daily, so understanding key statistical concepts is essential for analyzing data effectively.

#### 🔢 Basic Algebra & Probability:
- **Algebra:** Helps you work with formulas and equations.
- **Probability:** Allows you to make predictions based on data.

##### Example:
If 60% of customers buy product A and 30% buy product B, what’s the chance a customer buys both?  
(Use **Bayes' Theorem** for advanced probability predictions.)

#### 📊 Descriptive Statistics:
These summarize data, such as:
- **Mean (Average):** Sum of values divided by count.
- **Median:** Middle value when sorted.
- **Mode:** Most frequent value.
- **Variance & Standard Deviation:** How spread out the data is.

#### 🧑‍🏫 Example:
By analyzing customer ages, the **mean** and **mode** help target marketing efforts more effectively.

#### 🔬 Inferential Statistics:
These allow you to make predictions about a population based on sample data:
- **Hypothesis Testing (A/B Testing):** Test marketing strategies.
- **Confidence Intervals:** Measure estimate reliability.
- **Correlation vs. Causation:** Understand if two variables are related.

##### Example:
A company tests its website layout with A/B Testing to check if sales increased after a design change.

### 1.3 💻 Excel & Google Sheets for Data Analysis

Excel and Google Sheets are essential tools for data analysts. Start with these before transitioning to more advanced tools like SQL or Python.

#### 📈 Essential Excel Functions for Analysts:
- **Basic Math:** `SUM`, `AVERAGE`, `COUNT`
- **Lookups:** `VLOOKUP`, `HLOOKUP`, `INDEX-MATCH`
- **Text Functions:** `TRIM`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, `MID` (for data cleaning)
- **Logical Functions:** `IF` statements, `Nested IFs`

##### Example:
- Calculate total sales → `=SUM(B2:B100)`
- Find customer name based on ID → `=VLOOKUP(101, A2:C100, 2, FALSE)`

#### 🧹 Data Cleaning & Manipulation:
- **Removing Duplicates**: Eliminate duplicate data.
- **Find & Replace**: Fix errors in large datasets.
- **Text-to-Columns**: Split data into separate columns.

##### Example:
If customer names are written as "JohnDoe," use **Text Functions** to clean them to "John Doe."

#### 📊 Pivot Tables & Data Visualization:
- **Pivot Tables:** Quickly summarize large datasets.
- **Conditional Formatting:** Highlight important data points.
- **Charts & Graphs:** Create bar, pie, and histogram charts.

##### Example:
Using **Pivot Tables**, identify which products sold the most and which months had the highest sales.
