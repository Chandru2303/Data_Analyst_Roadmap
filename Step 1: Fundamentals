# ðŸ“Š Step 1: Learn the Fundamentals

## 1.1 Understanding Data Analytics

Before diving into tools and coding, it's essential to understand what Data Analytics is and how it is used in real-world scenarios.

### ðŸ“Œ What is Data Analytics?

Data Analytics is the process of examining raw data to uncover trends, patterns, and insights that help businesses make informed decisions.

### ðŸ“Œ Types of Data Analytics

There are four main types of analytics, each answering different business questions:

| **Type of Analytics**   | **Purpose**                                 | **Example**                                      |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Descriptive Analytics**  | Summarizes past data                      | Monthly sales report, Website traffic trends     |
| **Diagnostic Analytics**   | Explains why something happened           | Why did sales drop last quarter?                 |
| **Predictive Analytics**   | Uses data to forecast future outcomes     | Predicting customer churn or sales trends       |
| **Prescriptive Analytics** | Recommends actions based on predictions   | What should a business do to increase sales?     |

#### ðŸ”¹ Example:

A retail company wants to increase sales. They use:
- **Descriptive Analytics** to see last yearâ€™s sales trends.
- **Diagnostic Analytics** to find out why sales dipped in certain months.
- **Predictive Analytics** to forecast next monthâ€™s demand.
- **Prescriptive Analytics** to decide on pricing or promotions.

## 1.2 Mathematics & Statistics for Data Analytics

Since Data Analysts work with numbers, a solid understanding of statistics and mathematical concepts is crucial.

### ðŸ“Œ Basic Algebra & Probability

- **Algebra:** Helps in working with formulas, equations, and data modeling.
- **Probability:** Helps in making predictions and assessing risk.

#### ðŸ”¹ Example:

If 60% of customers buy product A and 30% buy product B, what is the probability of a customer buying both?  
*Use Bayes' Theorem for probability-based predictions.*

### ðŸ“Œ Descriptive Statistics

Descriptive statistics summarize data using:

- **Mean (Average):** The sum of values divided by the number of values.
- **Median:** The middle value when data is sorted.
- **Mode:** The most frequently occurring value.
- **Variance & Standard Deviation:** Measures how spread out the data is.

#### ðŸ”¹ Example:

If you analyze customer ages, finding the **average age (mean)** and most common age (mode) helps businesses target marketing efforts.

### ðŸ“Œ Inferential Statistics

Inferential statistics allow you to make conclusions about a population based on sample data:

- **Hypothesis Testing (A/B Testing):** Used to test marketing strategies.
- **Confidence Intervals:** Measures reliability of an estimate.
- **Correlation vs. Causation:** Determines if two variables move together.

#### ðŸ”¹ Example:

A company changes its website layout. Using **A/B Testing**, they compare old vs. new layouts to check if sales increased.

## 1.3 Excel & Google Sheets for Data Analysis

Many companies use **Excel/Google Sheets** for data analysis before transitioning to SQL or Python.

### ðŸ“Œ Essential Excel Functions for Analysts

- **Basic Mathematical Operations:** `SUM`, `AVERAGE`, `COUNT`
- **Searching Data:** `VLOOKUP`, `HLOOKUP`, `INDEX-MATCH`
- **Text Functions:** `TRIM`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, `MID` (for cleaning data)
- **Logic Functions:** `IF` Statements & Nested `IFs`

#### ðŸ”¹ Example:

- Find the total sales in a dataset â†’ `=SUM(B2:B100)`
- Get customer name from an ID table â†’ `=VLOOKUP(101, A2:C100, 2, FALSE)`

### ðŸ“Œ Data Cleaning & Manipulation

- **Removing Duplicates:** Identify and remove duplicate records.
- **Find & Replace:** Fix errors in large datasets quickly.
- **Text-to-Columns:** Split data into separate columns.

#### ðŸ”¹ Example:

You receive a dataset where customer names are stored as "JohnDoe" instead of "John Doe". Using **Text Functions**, you can clean it automatically.

### ðŸ“Œ Pivot Tables & Data Visualization

- **Pivot Tables:** Summarize large datasets quickly.
- **Conditional Formatting:** Highlight important trends visually.
- **Charts & Graphs:** Create bar charts, pie charts, and histograms.

#### ðŸ”¹ Example:

You have sales data for 2024. Using **Pivot Tables**, you can see:
- Which products sell the most?
- Which months have the highest sales?
